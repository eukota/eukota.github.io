Slide Deck best practices include providing concise, bulleted lists that an audience can read without becoming so distracted they don\u2019t listen to the speaker and speakers providing most of the information. A slide deck without the speaker is often uninformative. Conversely, a slide deck that provides enough information for someone to understand it without the speaker is not a good slide deck. Slide decks should be used for presentations and that is all. Videos as Documentation Videos help convey a steady stream of information. They can hold an immense amount of information but, like a book, require users to consume the entire video to find one piece of desired information. As we would not ask someone to read a book in search of information, asking them to watch a video is also not good documentation practice.

In each instance, the underlying technology was Confluence. But the overall design could be applied to any system. Where possible, I have tried to adapt but it is a work in progress. What? Intentional Documentation is the application of engineering principles to documentation. These pages present the idea along with proposed adoption strategies. This documentation was originally written while leveraging the Confluence Wiki to generate documentation. While instructions around use of Confluence are here and work well, the overall direction of organizing documentation remains consistent. Why? Speed up understanding of material, speed up onboarding, build a single source of truth, build client trust, reduce support cost, and most of all, provide repetition and consistency. How? For a top-down approach, establish an audience page map and page style guide and drive adoption with support feedback loops, and curators - all covered here. For a bottom-up approach, add Table of Contents (TOC) macros, PageTree macros, and begin to apply TOC Driven Documentation and get reviews on your docs. Do both! Getting started Common Challenges Documentation is always out of date! This is a symptom of poorly maintained documentation often without a Support Feedback Loop or Documentation Review practices.

When that research is to make a decision, I have found this decision pattern to help keep from ending with too many unfinished pages which happen when the team ultimately makes a decision and then leaves all the research pages lying about. Step 1: Decisions Aggregate Page Create a Decisions top-level page that only lists all the decisions pages. Step 2: Create a Decision Template Create a template which contains all of the details you want to have about a decision. Minimally, the template should include: Table of Contents Overview with Excerpt - to be leveraged in annotated aggregate pages Decision - highlighted in a way at the top Analysis - could extend to multiple sections or additional pages going over the research and analysis Step 3: Archive Completed Decisions Make one Completed Decisions aggregate page and move any completed decision into that section. Benefits This basic pattern ensures that team decisions are documented with the research provided. It ensures that past decisions can be reviewed by current or new team members - this can save a lot of time when a new team member or someone else not in the know wants to know why a decision was made. It ensures that research about a topic has a permanent location to live instead of cluttering up team documentation pages. Over time, you may find this pattern helps the team to better hone decisions and become more disciplined about researching them. Documentation Phases Draft, review, and publish your documentation.

In TDD, engineers write tests first and use those tests to help build their functions. This creates code that is easier to test and forces the engineers to consider what they are trying to build ahead of time. We can apply a similar strategy for documentation. I use TOC Driven Documentation or TDD as a play on words here. The idea is that building documentation should be done intentionally with just as much thought put into documentation structure as you would put into coding structure. This applies to the overall document organization as well as to content pages. Why TOC Driven Documentation leads to better results. Thinking about the structure of your documents will help you present your information in a more organized manner and help those looking for clarity to find information faster. How In TOC Driven Documentation, ensure you are focused on building documents using TOCs as opposed to adding TOCs afterwards. Step 1: Create Your Outline Create an outline for your documentation first. Think about these questions as you create the outline: Who is your audience? What is your page about? What are the major parts of your document? Your outline should have multiple headings and ideally have multiple levels of headings. Step 2: Add a TOC Macro Add a TOC macro to the top and save your page. Review your TOC and the headings your created. Step 3: Fill in Your Docs Visit each of your headings and begin filling in the content. Notice this is the first point that you are adding content to your docs.

It is a set of proposed standards that we try to get everyone to follow which, when used together, help make the documentation have a common form and flow. Why When reading documentation, consistency is the key. Establishing a Page Style Guide helps speed up documentation creation by authors on your system as well as enabling users to more quickly explore and digest the information. Page Types Page types define the different types of pages that are part of the page style guide and what they should look like. Front Page Type The front page is a freeform landing page for a concept or topic with a lot of child pages Page Style Benefits convey information for multiple audiences at a glance provide fast contact information relating to the documents encourage freeform and flexible landing pages Requirements \u201cinfo\u201d macro at the top with a brief description of the topic excerpt macro for use by dynamically annotated aggregate pages provide overall direction for users to consume child pages Strategies A good front page is more around presenting good introductions to your topic with sufficient organization. Things to include: Introduction at the top - what is this page all about? An \u201cinfo\u201d macro is nice. Use multiple columns Include who the primary contacts are about the page/product/support-model/etc Include a diagram! Diagrams help convey topics and are attention-grabbing Include a page tree partway down that shows all the child pages Include persona-based Deep Link pages or just sections to help different types of personas who will view your page find the information they most care about quickly Aggregate Page Type The aggregate page type is a page containing child pages. It should not contain any content. Page Style Benefits dynamically annotated page tree with optional localized (child-only) search ensure author thinks carefully about overall pages architecture keeping content away helps ensure single-source-of-truth for content keeping content away avoids mixed purposes Requirements Excerpt macro at the top PageTree macro NO CONTENT Formatting When adding the PageTree macro, consider setting the following minimum options: Root Page set to \u201c@self\u201d - this ensures old child pages of the current page will be displayed Include Excerpts in Page Tree checked - this provides for the dynamically annotated page trees we want to see! Show Expand/Collapse Links checked - this adds a convenient way to quickly see the full depth of the page tree If this page tree has a lot of child page content or is deeply nested, consider also setting: Include Search Box above Page Tree checked - this will put a search box above the page tree that searches only within the page tree (Note: The search box has no heading so you may want to add something like \u201cSearch in the Pages:\u201d) Content Page Type The Content Page Type is the page that holds the most information. It is the leaf-node containing all of your documentation. Aggregate Pages, Front Pages, and Deep Links Pages are all part of the organizational control to support making information in Content Pages easy to find. Content Page Style Benefits A TOC macro for your page with minimal heading structure in place encourage authors to think of their pages in the broader sense when writing an explanation for what it is provide an annotated entry for aggregate pages to draw upon encourage authors to think about how to structure headings so that the TOC makes for intuitive reading opportunity for authors to pre-structure their doc for future editors to expand on Requirements The content page is the meat of the documentation. This is where all the diagrams, paragraphs and sources of truth lie. The content page must have: A table of contents (TOC) macro at the top Excerpt Macro within first H1 heading Carefully planned headings NO CHILD PAGES Formatting The TOC doesn\u2019t have a heading by default so add one in paragraph bold that reads \u201cTable of Contents\u201d Make sure to use an excerpt macro just under the first level 1 heading with a brief single sentence synopsis of the purpose of the page. This is to support the Aggregate Page Type usage of a dynamically annotated page tree. Deep Links Page Type A Deep Links Page is an Aggregate Page with links but not Child Pages. The Deep Links Page is a necessity born out of the intertwined relationship of information. To ensure a consistency across documentation, only one style of presentation can be used. This necessarily means that other ways of finding the information are not used. Deep Links Pages help compensate. Page Style Benefits able to provide links based on aggregate topics not already present in document structure be intentional about deep links by topic without confusing readers about location (eg: we don\u2019t want to have two different ways of interpreting where to put documentation - just use a deeplinks page to overcome the limits of aggregation) Requirements Excerpt macro at the top Hand-curated list of links or use a macro that relies on labels NO CONTENT NO CHILD PAGES Strategies Deep Links pages are a necessity because it is not possible to build out the perfect documentation every time. There will always be sets of pages that go well together in different contexts. The best solution is to adopt a consistent organization and then use deep links pages to meet the needs for document aggregation that the organization doesn\u2019t end up supporting. You can always build up deep links pages by hand. While they do run the risk of getting out of date, you have to start somewhere. Examples Some common examples of deep links page uses. Support pages - often aggregate information together that clients may need but the information is scattered throughout the development pages Text Styles Text styles help explain when to use bold or italic fonts, paragraphs, bulleted lists, and more. I recommend keeping this simple lest your style guide become so hard to follow that people ignore it. Page Relationships Establish page types and how they relate to one another.

Whenever someone asked me a question, I followed the process outlined here. Why Following a support feedback loop helps to build a knowledge base over time which has numerous benefits both for your team and your users: builds a consistent curated set of answers to questions answers can be leveraged by support staff both new and experienced builds trust in your team and your product reduced support time as users begin to use your documentation instead of asking you over and over How A support feedback loop is illustrated in this diagram - the goal is to build a knowledge base. When receiving a question: Check to see if the answer is in the documentation If it IS NOT present, then add the answer to the documentation If it IS present, check if it was easy to find: 1. If it IS NOT easy to find, then make it easier to find 2. If it IS easy to find, do not change the docs Provide an answer with: Gracious professionalism - thank you A brief or summarized answer to the question A link to the documentation If their question led you to update your documentation, make sure to thank them for that Etiquette When providing feedback, it\u2019s critical not to be condescending.

Scrum relies on cross-functional teams to deliver products and services in short cycles, enabling: Fast feedback Quicker innovation Continuous improvement Rapid adaptation to change More delighted customers Accelerated pace from idea to delivery Scrum Is Iterative & Incremental Scrum is also both iterative and incremental. Iterative Iterative processes are a way to arrive at a decision or a desired result by repeating rounds of analysis or a cycle of operations. The objective is to bring the desired decision or result closer to discovery with each repetition (iteration). Scrum\u2019s use of a repeating cycle of iterations is iterative. Incremental Incremental refers to a series of small improvements to an existing product or product line that usually helps maintain or improve its competitive position over time. Incremental innovation is regularly used within the high technology business by companies that need to continue to improve their products to include new features increasingly desired by consumers. The way scrum teams deliver pieces of functionality into small batches is incremental. The Five Scrum Values A team\u2019s success with scrum depends on five values: commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect. Commitment Allows Scrum Teams to Be Agile The scrum value of commitment is essential for building an agile culture. Scrum teams work together as a unit. This means that scrum and agile teams trust each other to follow through on what they say they are going to do. When team members aren\u2019t sure how work is going, they ask. Agile teams only agree to take on tasks they believe they can complete, so they are careful not to overcommit. Courage Allows Scrum Teams to Be Agile The Scrum value of courage is critical to an agile team\u2019s success. Scrum teams must feel safe enough to say no, to ask for help, and to try new things. Agile teams must be brave enough to question the status quo when it hampers their ability to succeed. Focus Allows Scrum Teams to Be Agile The scrum value of focus is one of the best skills scrum teams can develop. Focus means that whatever scrum teams start they finish\u2013so agile teams are relentless about limiting the amount of work in process (limit WIP). Openness Allows Scrum Teams to Be Agile Scrum teams consistently seek out new ideas and opportunities to learn. Agile teams are also honest when they need help. Respect Allows Scrum Teams to Be Agile Scrum team members demonstrate respect to one another, to the product owner, to stakeholders, and to the Scrum Master. Agile teams know that their strength lies in how well they collaborate and that everyone has a distinct contribution to make toward completing the work of the sprint. They respect each other\u2019s ideas, give each other permission to have a bad day once in a while, and recognize each other\u2019s accomplishments.","title":"Scrum Framework"},{"location":"engineering/scrum_framework.html#scrum-is-iterative-incremental","text":"Scrum is also both iterative and incremental.","title":"Scrum Is Iterative &amp; Incremental"},{"location":"engineering/scrum_framework.html#iterative","text":"Iterative processes are a way to arrive at a decision or a desired result by repeating rounds of analysis or a cycle of operations.

All teams train. Training has numerous benefits to the individual, the team, and the company. Address Weaknesses and Skill Gaps It\u2019s inevitable that employees will have some type of weaknesses in their workplace skills. The good news is there\u2019s always room for improvement. A training program gives everyone the opportunity to strengthen those skills. This helps ensure that everyone on your team is up to par and can perform their job day in and day out. With proper training and development, weakness can turn into strengths and your employees can excel. Improve Performance Once weaknesses are turned into strengths, your employees will really have the chance to improve their performance. Training gives everyone a great understanding of their responsibilities and the knowledge and skills they need to do that job. This will enhance their confidence which can also improve their overall performance. Additionally, they\u2019ll know the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of their role and your company to the point where they can come up with strategy ideas and help other teammates improve. Foster Growth The bottom line of any business is financial growth. If one could do it alone, there would be no need for a workforce. And every workforce must be trained. The better the training, the better your company\u2019s growth. Your most valuable employees are ambitious and have room to grow. By giving them the training they need to maximize their skills, they will be able to fill out those hard to reach goals that only the most talented and dedicated employees can. Enhance Satisfaction By investing in training, companies show their employees that they are valued and that they matter. Because training gives employees access to information they wouldn\u2019t have had access to, they feel rewarded with a sense of satisfaction that employees at corporations with poor training programs tend to lack. This goes a long way in making employees feel appreciated and satisfied with their careers. Increase Consistency An effective training program ensures that employees have a consistent experience and background of knowledge. This consistency is extremely important when it comes to understanding processes, products, or services. For example, a robust customer service training program ensures that your agents and reps are more likely to deliver a consistent experience to customers. Or, for a sales team, this means that everyone knows how to deliver a great first demo. This is a great way to make sure all employees are aware of the expectations and best practices of their team. Reduce Turnover Employee turnaround costs you time and money. By training your staff proactively, you can improve their confidence and their abilities. Fewer mistakes will be made, so fewer people will have to be fired as a result of accidents. Frustration levels will be lower. And you will develop a team of experts that you and your team can be proud of. Enhance Company Reputation A strong training program is a great way to improve your company\u2019s brand and reputation. Employees want to have access to ongoing training and development opportunities. So, by offering different types of training, your company is likely to attract new talent.","title":"Training"},{"location":"engineering/training.html#why-train","text":"All teams train.

EE 505 - Probability and Random Processes Description - Foundations for the engineering analysis of random processes: set theoretic fundamentals, basic axioms of probability models, conditional probabilities and independence, discrete and continuous random variables, multiple random variables, sequences of random variables, limit theorems, models of stochastic processes, noise, stationarity and ergodicity, Gaussian processes, power spectral densities. Thoughts - This was the combination catchup-to-math and weeder class for the UW MSEE program while I was there. It was tough but rewarding. Having done grad school before, I was prepared for the onslaught of material but many were caught unaware. EE 505 Homework 1 EE 558 - Substation and Distribution Automation Description - Examines how smart grid technologies affect substation and distribution operations and how history, customer expectations, and state and federal policies have shaped the existing infrastructure. Studies the capabilities of various emerging technologies to assess how they are able to solve existing issues. Thoughts - This was taught by Kevin Schneider who was Chair for the Seattle Chapter of IEEE Power & Energy Society at the time and I was Webmaster. It was great taking the course from Kevin and I really enjoyed the material. The final project around using GridLab-D was especially fun. EE 558 8500 Node Test Feeder Final Project Report EE 553 - Power System Economics Description - Economic structure of power systems. Problem formulation, optimization methods and programming for economic analysis of power system operation and planning. Economic dispatch, load forecasting, unit commitment, interchange, planning and reliability analysis. Provides background to pursue advanced work in planning and operation. Thoughts - This was a fascinating class that actually focused a lot on learing the Mosel programming language to perform economic dispatch optimizations. The programming itself came down to integer programming. I suspect that ML will replace it at some point. The final project report is comprehensive - take a look! EE 553 Homework 6 Report - cool Tikz plots in LaTeX EE 553 Economic Dispatch Final Project Report EE 557 - Dynamics of Controlled Systems Description - Explores control techniques for high precision motion control. Covers sate variable feedback of linear and nonlinear, multivariable systems in depth. Uses physical system modeling, graphical analysis, and numerical analysis to describe system performance. Uses simulation mini-projects to emphasize the dynamics of controlled systems and their performance. Thoughts - This was the first of two courses I took taught by Nicholas Nagel who is an amazing teacher. Prof Nagel brought out the best in terms of report quality from me. My friend Ryan Smith was in the course too and he and I would see who could produce the most amazing report. We had fun learning different LaTeX techniques together too. Some reports follow. EE 557 Homework 1 Report - This copy has a couple mistakes and has the source code removed from the end of the report. I challenge you to find the errors! EE 556 - Analyzing the Power Grid Description - The course explores the basic concepts for power system analysis. It also presents the modelling of transmission lines, transformers and generators for power system studies. Simplified methods to analyze grids with different voltage levels are discussed. Power system tools including power flows and fault analysis are then described and applied in illustrative examples. Thoughts - This class was a critical one for me. Writing a Newton-Raphson load flow algorithm from scratch was on my bucket list. The source code for it is on GitHub here: MATLAB Newton-Raphson Load Flow EE 556 Newton-Raphson Load Flow Project Report EE 551 - Wind Energy Description - Covers the operation and modeling of wind energy, wind statistics, wind generators and converters, wind energy systems, challenges to wind energy development, impacts of wind energy on the power grid, and existing and potential solutions to wind energy integration. Thoughts - This course was taught by the late Mohammed El Shakawri and was his final time teaching the course. It was fascinating learing and being able to calculate exactly how wind turbines generate power and exploring the ancillary services that modern wind farms with their power electronics are able to provide to the grid. EE 551 HW1 Report EE 551 HW5 Report EE 551 HW6 Report EE 560 - Advanced Machines and Drives Description - Servo control requires proper knowledge and understanding of electric machines and power electronic drives. This course gives fundamental principles of AC and DC drive systems including machine structures and driver topologies. The fundamentals of brush DC, Brushless DC (BLDC), PM synchronous, and induction machines are explored. In addition, inverter topologies and control techniques are presented. The course begins with the basics of DC machines and extends to the concept of field orientation in AC machines. Thoughts - This was the second course I took taught by Nicholas Nagel and it was incredibly challenging and rewarding. The final project involved building out an electric motor controller for a Tesla induction machine. Super cool. We got to use a power electronics simulator called PLECS by Plexim which was also amazing to work with. EE 560 Tesla Controller Report EE 590 - Applied High Performance GPU Computing Description - Introduction, evolution, and overview of parallel computing and overview to OpenCL. OpenCL host and kernel programming details, host and kernel programming details. Parallel software and performance theory, parallel FFT on GPU. Case studies in machine learning, image processing, and scientific visualization with GPUs and OpenCL. Thoughts - This was a custom class in which we learned to write OpenCL for GPU programming. I bought a laptop with a GPU that I could program so that I could avoid going to the lab. I still have that laptop. It is currently my electronics workbench lab machine. For my final project, I worked with a classmate Eric Wilson to use parallel programming to downsample a radar data.

It also presents the modelling of transmission lines, transformers and generators for power system studies. Simplified methods to analyze grids with different voltage levels are discussed. Power system tools including power flows and fault analysis are then described and applied in illustrative examples. Thoughts - This class was a critical one for me. Writing a Newton-Raphson load flow algorithm from scratch was on my bucket list.

Thoughts - This course was taught by the late Mohammed El Shakawri and was his final time teaching the course. It was fascinating learing and being able to calculate exactly how wind turbines generate power and exploring the ancillary services that modern wind farms with their power electronics are able to provide to the grid.

This course gives fundamental principles of AC and DC drive systems including machine structures and driver topologies. The fundamentals of brush DC, Brushless DC (BLDC), PM synchronous, and induction machines are explored. In addition, inverter topologies and control techniques are presented. The course begins with the basics of DC machines and extends to the concept of field orientation in AC machines. Thoughts - This was the second course I took taught by Nicholas Nagel and it was incredibly challenging and rewarding. The final project involved building out an electric motor controller for a Tesla induction machine. Super cool. We got to use a power electronics simulator called PLECS by Plexim which was also amazing to work with.

I bought a laptop with a GPU that I could program so that I could avoid going to the lab. I still have that laptop. It is currently my electronics workbench lab machine. For my final project, I worked with a classmate Eric Wilson to use parallel programming to downsample a radar data.

Looking for a final project, my Dad had pointed out that him and his partner could use an automated water tank reading tool. They live in a wooden 5 story water tower that has been converted to a residence down in Mendocino County. The 6000 gallon water tank on the top floor is their supply. To fill it, they manually turned on a pump and then listened for when the overflow would start running down the side of the house. So I did some research and found this cool design that used PTFE insulated wire to build a capacitance probe in which the insulation is the dialectric and the wire and the water form the capacitor. Measuring the capacitance of the wire then tells the depth of the water - provided the wire is run to to bottom of the tank in a continuous loop to avoid corrosion. Details on that attempt are at HSU Courses: IT251 . Long story short - I didn\u2019t get it working. 2019 - Second Iteration - Ultrasonic Sensor In 2019, I finally got around to buying myself an oscilloscope and variable power supply and building out my electronics workbench . Excited to get back to my projects, which I had previously only been able to do while borrowing lab time at universities, I began with the Water Tank Meter. I reviewed the original capacitance probe design. I bought some PTFE insulated wire and tried to measure its capacitance. It was going to complicated! So I looked around and thought maybe I could get away with using an ultrasonic distance sensor from the top of the tank looking down into the water. I confirmed that the tank empties and fills from the bottom which ensures that the top should remain relatively smooth. Parts list Raspberry Pi Zero W Ultrasonic Distance Sensor HC-SR04 Compatible 16GB Card with NOOBS 3.0 12V Power Cable Build I had always wanted to use a Raspberry Pi so I picked up the cheapest one I could find with Wifi - the Raspberry Pi Zero W . After a bit of setup and wrestling with the wireless configuration files, I got the device setup and was excited to ssh into it over wifi. I picked up a cheap ultrasonic sensor and in a storke of luck, it turned out that the Pi Zero W had output voltage pins that matched the input needs of the sensor, so I didn\u2019t need to build a voltage divider or do any additional circuitry. I bought a small box to put it all in and borrowed some shop time at my friend\u2019s shop to use his drill press to make the ultrasonic sensor holes as precise as possible. Code Most of the code I wrote for this project is available in a repository on GitHub at Eukota/IoT . We deployed Installation We preconfigured the device to prefer my Dad\u2019s wireless network with mine second so that I could ship him the device. After it was installed, I set up a family Slack group and app and configured a CRON job to post the last logged data point once per hour to a Slack channel. Travel and Usage We got the system working just before my Dad and his partner travelled to France. As the water tank also supplies water to their rental, it was important that they be able to know the water level so they could more accurately fill the tank as needed - by asking a neighbor to turn the pump on!

It was an excellent beginning music program - at the conclusion of the year, I was playing first chair in the elementary symphony that had 100 musicians with 6 trombones. That summer, we relocated to Northern California. 1992 - Baritone Horn, Alto Sax, Clarinet, Snare Drum, Flute, Piano, Guitar, Recorder This was a strange time for me. We relocated from South Pasadena where introductions to music included a robust program and 5th grade was the last elementary grade level. By contrast, Anderson Valley had 6th grade as the last elementary grade level - so I inadvertently graduated from elementary school twice! The music program was not as robust and the songs we played vastly simpler. Worse, the music instructor did not teach trombone before 7th grade. My parents enrolled me in piano lessons and I began self-teaching recorder. At the elementary school, I learned every song the music teacher had on every instrument they had available. Although this meant the above list is very long, my skill on piano and recorder is what excelled the most. 1997 - Tuba, Sousaphone The music program at AVHS suffered a lot of setbacks when I was in school. In a bid to keep it going, my Dad and several other concerned parents focused on securing volunteers to teach the program for a small stipend each year. This meant that while the program was ostensibly still going, we had a different instructor every year so no real long-term growth around music theory. It was more a smorgasboard of different songs each year. In 1997, the band director for Mendocino HS, Bob Ayres, retired. He agreed to take on our school on a lighter basis. He was amazing. He brought our marching band back, added several ensembles, and had all students learning music theory too. He wanted a tuba player and had many of us trombone players so he asked if I\u2019d like to play tuba. He got me a brand new 3/4 size Yamaha tuba to play - it still took a lot of air. I then learned to play sousaphone for the marching band too. 2001 - Djembe In the second half of my time at UCSC, I did a multitude of extra-curricular activities. There was an afro-cuban drum class on campus which connected me with a West African drum class in town. I got to play accompanyment for a West African dance class from time to time which was an invigorating experience every time. When I graduated from UCSC in 2002, I bought myself a nice Djembe from New Guinea along with a really nice carrying case. Later while attending Humboldt State University in Arcata, I attended the West African Drumming classes they had for two years. I still remember all the patterns to play along with several specific songs. I definitely miss hand drumming. 2003 - Mandolin While living with Turtle in Santa Cruz, I acquired a mandolin on the cheap and signed up for some private mandolin lessons. I recall learning more standard mandolin rhythm keeping but also fun stuff like Take 5 by Dave Brubek. 2004 - Dumbek and Drum Kit While living in Santa Cruz and exploring the music scene, I met Rick Walker and ended up taking dumbek and drum kit lessons from him. It was sadly just at the end of my time there so I was only able to learn for a few months before I moved away in 2004. I still have my dumbek and still play it some and still have my drum kit skills although they are very rusty. 2010 - Great Highland Bagpipes Sometime in the early 2000\u2019s, my Grammy shipped me this practice chanter kit. When I moved to Texas, I found myself isolated without much musical opportunity. Then I found the Abilene Pipers and began the long road to learning to play the Great Highland Bagpipes. They helped me buy my own set used from someone in New Orleans and I made steady progress. It wasn\u2019t until I moved to Seattle 2013 and joined the Washington Scottish Pipers that I began to take the instrument more seriously. Then around 2018, when my first kid was getting more interactive, I had trouble convincing myself to keep up the gigging and practice. I later spent several months utilizing the Pipers Dojo in preparation to play for my Grandad\u2019s funeral. It was during this time that I learned how to fully tune my instrument and began to really understand the presure requirements and how to play steady. 2019 - Ukelele The Ukelele was always a fascinating instrument. Jon Marcille noted that he played it. As I continued to struggle to find time to play music with kids in the house and as traveling with a big guitar continued to be difficult, I bought a baritone ukelele and began learning it. I was pleasantly surprised to find it super easy to pick up - though I shouldn\u2019t be that surprised having played guitar as a hobby since 1992. 2022 - More Drum Kit I continue to play an eclectic mix of instruments. Whatever fits my fancy in the moment. I like to take my ukelele when traveling along with a recorder or two and a penny whistle. I like that I can play most of my bagpipe tunes on the recorders and the penny whistle. I\u2019ve got two kids learning piano and recorder and one of them is working on drum kit with me. We bought a kids size 5-piece Drum Kit in December 2021 and Edward and I are following along on Mike\u2019s Lessons .

Although I can make many animals and flowers, my real passion in origami is in popup cards and unit origami like those created by Tomoko Fuse . Here are a few pics of both I have made in the past few years. This is the construction of an icosahedron which has 30 edges and 20 faces. For those D&D folks, this is a D20. Here is another icosahedron but made with squares just 2.125\u201d across. These are challenging to make and assemble at this size but can be made with just two sheets of letter-sized paper. This is a popup card from a book by Masahiro Chatani . I got the book randomly while visiting my Uncle Brian in New York when I was just 14.

STARtech - Circa 1997 I built this site along with two friends when we were in High School around 1997. The site was part of a competition at the time called STARtech. Our site used some Java applets to demonstrate how reconomibant DNA worked and included a neat 3D interactive DNA model. Presently the old Java Applet doesn\u2019t work. Might be a fun thing for me to restore one day via modern code options. Visit STARtech Website The Dark Crystal - Circa 2000 While attending UC Santa Cruz, I took a really cool class titled \u201cMuppet Magic\u201d. The class explored puppets in general but did focus a lot on Jim Henson and the history of the muppets. We watched The Muppet Movie during one lecture and the entire class sang along with The Rainbow Connection. It was such a cool class. We were given an option to turn in some course material in an interesting fashion. Since knowing how to build your own websites wasn\u2019t exactly common knowledge at the time, me and a friend of mine built our own and paired them together. I loved The Dark Crystal movie and Megan was obsessed with David Bowie in the Labyrinth movie so we each built little fan sites. Those are now preserved here. Visit Labyrinth and Dark Crystal Websites Solar Barn - Circa 2005 While attending Humbodlt State University , I took a class titled Engr305: Appropriate Technology from Lonny Grafman . There were many amazing things about that class. One of the coolest was Lonny allowing us to turn in our final report in almost any form of media we wished - from paper reports, to presentations, to websites. I built this website and I still have it. The site goes over the entire process of building out a small solar photovoltaic array of 480W supporting a 225 Amp Hr battery bank that is used to run the lighting in a barn. Topic covered include system sizing, panel angles, noon hour efficiency calculations, system wiring, and more. The site has turned out to be a great resource over time for myself in remembering the work and for others.
