# Instruments

Listed in chronological order as I learned them.

## 1991 - Trombone

## 1992 - Baritone Horn, Alto Sax, Clarinet, Snare Drum, Flute, Piano, Guitar, Recorder

## 1997 - Tuba, Sousaphone

## 2001 - Djembe

In the second half of my time at UCSC, I did a multitude of extra curricular activities. There was an afro-cuban drum class on campus which connected me with a West African drum class in town. I got to play accompanyment for a West African dance class from time to time which was an invigorating experience every time.

When I graduated from UCSC in 2002, I bought myself a nice Djembe from New Guinea along with a really nice carrying case.

Later while attending Humboldt State University in Arcata, I attended the West African classes they had for two years. I still remember all the patterns to play along with several specific songs. I definitely miss hand drumming.

## 2003 - Mandolin

While living with Turtle in Santa Cruz, I acquired a mandolin on the cheap and signed up for some private mandolin lessons. I recall learning more standard mandolin rhythm keeping but also fun stuff like Take 5 by Dave Brubek.

## 2004 - Dumbek and Drum Kit

While living in Santa Cruz and exploring the music scene, I met [Rick Walker](http://www.looppool.info/) and ended up taking dumbek and drum kit lessons from him. It was sadly just at the end of my time there so I was only able to learn for a few months before I moved away in 2004. I still have my dumbek and still play it some and still have my drum kit skills although they are very rusty.

## 2010 - Great Highland Bagpipes

## 2019 - Ukelele

The Ukelele was always a fascinating instrument. Jon Marcille noted that he played it. As I continued to struggle to find time to play music with kids in the house and as traveling with a big guitar continued to be difficult, I bought a baritone ukelele and began learning it. I was pleasantly surprised to find it super easy to pick up - though I shouldn't be that surprised having played guitar as a hobby since 1992.
