# Kids

I love music and I want my kids to get the best experience possible. I hope to get at least one lifelong musician out of them - if not a professional then at least some hobbiests.

I have so many instruments and we keep a lot around the house. I continue to play and sing songs with the kids while I play ukelele. We have signed them up for piano lessons and introduction to music courses.

I bought them a kid sized 5-piece drum kit for Christmas in 2021 and we signed up for some lessons at [Mike's Lessons](https://mikeslessons.com). We continue to improve.

We also get to attend a drum circle when time and safety (read: COVID) permit.
