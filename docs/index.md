# Hello

After years of ignoring my website and really being at a loss for what to do with it, I have decided to migrate it to MkDocs running on GitHub Pages.

* The old WordPress site was too bulky
* Markdown is so lightweight
* I can now track history of my site

Does this mean I will edit my site more? Really not sure. >_>
