# Sites

These are some contained websites I have built over the years that I like to preserve.

## STARtech - Circa 1997

I built this site along with two friends when we were in High School around 1997. The site was part of a competition at the time called STARtech. Our site used some Java applets to demonstrate how reconomibant DNA worked and included a neat 3D interactive DNA model.

*Presently the old Java Applet doesn't work. Might be a fun thing for me to restore one day via modern code options.*

## Solar Barn - Circa 2006

While attending Humbodlt State University, I took this amazing class titled Appropriate Technology from Lonny Grafman. There were many amazing things about that class. One of the coolest was Lonny allowing us to turn in our final report in almost any form of media we wished - from paper reports, to presentations, to websites. I built this website and I still have it. And I still enjoy referring people to it too.
