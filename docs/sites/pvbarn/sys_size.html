<b>System Sizing</b>
<br>The system size grew each time I changed the design but the point of this page is to demonstrate the process by which I determined my system size. The first step I took was to do a Load List Analysis. This consisted of writing down every possible load on the system<i>(Load)</i>, the wattage for each load<i>(watts)</i>, the number of hours in a day that the load would be active<i>(hrs/day)</i>, and the days per week the load would be used<i>(days/week)</i>.
<p><img src="images/load_list.gif">
<p>The watts multiplied by the hrs/day multiplied by the days/week and divided by seven days total gave the average watt hours per day<i>(ave wh/d)</i>. The <i>total wh/d consumed</i> is 1025 Whrs/day.
<p>The next row, <i>pv "wh/d"</i>, takes into account the inefficiency of solar panels. Most panels are reputed to be about 80% efficient but just in case, I used an efficiency of 70%: 1025 divided by 0.70 = 1465 Whrs/day.
 
<p>The next row, <i>pv amp hr/day @ 12V</i>, is the total pv wh/d divided by 12V yielding 122 Ahrs/day. This number reflects the number of amp hours the proposed system would use daily.
<p>The next row, <i>pv amps in winter sun</i>, assumes three noon-hours for winter. Dividing 122 Ahrs/day by 3 gives 41 Ahrs. A noon hour is defined as an hour of full power production from a solar panel. Doug Livingston provided me with the numbers for my area: 7 noon-hours/day during the summer and 3 noon-hours/day during the winter.
<p>Using the nominal voltage of photovoltaic panels, the <i>pv watts @ 17V</i> is 17 x 41 = 692 Whrs.
<p>Using 120 watt solar panels, the <i>number of 120w pv</i> panels needed is 692 / 120 = 6.
<p>In this design, the <i>Timer</i> and <i>Motion Sensor</i> were to run all the time and functioned as a way of turning the inverter on and off. In the final design, the inverter goes into a power-saving mode called search mode where it slowly searches for an AC load. In search mode, our inverter uses less than 1 watt which eliminated the need for the separate sensor and timer.
<p>Every step of the way, our design errors on the side of caution. The final system calculations are noted below.
<p><img src="images/load_list_2.gif">
<p>Running through the calculations using a 24 volt system and the smaller number of loads gives the two 123 watt solar panels.
<p><p><b>Battery Sizing</b>
<br>Notice the <i>total wh/d consumed</i> is 590. The efficiency of the inverter I used is 90%. So 590 / 0.90 = 655 Watt hrs/day to produce the required 590 Watt hrs/day consumed by the system. For the 24 volt system, 590 / 24 = 27.3 Amp hrs/day. Using deep cycle batteries, the less I use of the battery each time, the longer they will last. I used four 6 volt 220 amp hour batteries in series creating 220 amp hours at 24 volts. The percentage of the battery bank used in one day is 27.3 / 220 = 12.4%. This is an extremely low use of the batteries. However, this system is off grid so if there is a three day long rain storm which is not at all uncommon for the area, then the batteries would be drained to 3 x 12.4 = 37.2%. This is still okay for deep cycle batteries.
<p>All bases are covered... in theory.
