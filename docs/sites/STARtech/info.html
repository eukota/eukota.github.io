<tr><td width=80%> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This page was actually created for three reasons.  The first was as a project for the Honors Biology class at Anderson Valley High School.  The second, which was decided later, was as a submission to the STARtech competition in Mendocino County.  The third one was to enrich the minds of the creators by helping them learn about computer programming and scripting and biology.</td></table><p>
