Jen has been raised by the Mystics and taught reading, writing, and history. He also learns of the prophecy for a Gelphling to find the shard and heal the Dark Crystal and that he is that Gelphling, uniting everything once again. Kira has been raised by the Podlings, a happy race often prayed upon by the Skeksis. When the Skeksis killed Kira's family, the Podlings took her in.<p class="indent">In the image, Kira is holding her pet named Fizzgig. (Isn't he cute!)<p class="indent">Although the hero of the story, Jen really isn't the brightest of the duo. Kira saves his life numerous times, from swamps, from Skeksis, from the Skeksis servants: Crystal Bats and Garthims. Kira can fly, talk with animals, and understands the prophecy and dangers much better than her counterpart.</h3></td></table><p><hr size=4 width="70%"><p><img src="../images/fizzgig.gif"><p><font size=8 color=#aa00ff> Fizzgig </font><table border=0 width=500><tr><td><p class="indent"><h3>Here is Fizzgig throwing a tantrum when Kira says he must stay home.</td></h3></table></center></body></html>
