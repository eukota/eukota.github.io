## What

Just like we do code reviews, even internal documentation should be reviewed. Possibly not to the point of requiring review prior to publishing but certainly soliciting feedback and improving the docs to meet an adopted [Page Style Guide](../per_project/page_style_guide.md).

## Why

Feedback allows us to accelerate our rate of growth or improvement. Unsolicited feedback, often unwelcome elsewhere, is like gold for anyone writing content.

## How

Strategies for ensuring documentation review happens:

### Light Weight

* [curators](../per_project/curators.md) take initiative to monitor all published documentation
* authors request reviews

### Disciplined

* leverage CODEOWNERS within GitHub or other source control systems via Pull Requests
* include documentation review as part of your Definition of Done
