## What

The Table of Contents (TOC) for a page is this case refers not just to a list of all headings at the top of the page but an interactive list that has local links allowing users to quickly jump to the selected section.

## Why

The TOC is one of the best places to start building good documentation. When a user reads your docs, they want to get to the information they need as quickly as possible. Within a single page, you could be covering multiple topics. A thoughtfully laid out TOC will allow a user to quickly jump to the section they need.

And building the TOC itself will lead you as an author to writing your documents in an easier-to-consume manner. More on that in the [TOC Drive Docs](toc_driven.md) page.

## How

 Most cloud-based and server-based documentation systems have built-in TOC macros.
 
 If you are writing Markdown within a lightweight code editor like VS Code or Sublime, there are a number of plugins available that can help generate TOCs.
