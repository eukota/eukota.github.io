## What

Curators are those who help maintain the overall page style guide and organization of your documents and are a critical piece of the overall strategy. Curators should evangelize your documentation organization and make themselves available to answer questions about where docs should go. 

## Why

Curators are culture carriers for your documentation. They are the primary points of contact both inside and outside your team.

* If a teammate wants to know where to put some information, they can ask the curator for a quick answer
* If a teammate wants to move information around, then engaging with the curator will produce the most consistent results across the documentation
* If a user is struggling to find something, they can ask the curator
* Because the overall documentation organization and style guide is supported and enforced by the curator, the documentation will be more consistent
* Curators help train the team on keeping the documentation consistent
* Curators evangelize the benefits of documentation to users

## How

Curators are intentionally named individuals whose role it is to monitor and help maintain a consistent organization of our documentation. It is beneficial to have a couple of curators who can be approached to with questions about where documentation should go.

### Monitor Pages

Curators should be aware of new pages and ensure that they

* meet established best practices around formatting
* follow adopted naming standards
* are located in the best location for their target audience

### Provide Reviews

Curators should be available to review documents upon request.

### Field Common Questions

The most common questions for curators are

* Where can I find docs on this subject?
* Where should I put docs about this subject?

### Stub Pages

When asked where documents should go, it is very effective to create the page for the user and send them a link to it.
