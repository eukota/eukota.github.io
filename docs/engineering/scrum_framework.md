!!! note "From the Scrum Alliance"
    Scrum is a lightweight yet incredibly powerful set of values, principles, and practices. Scrum relies on cross-functional teams to deliver products and services in short cycles, enabling:

    * Fast feedback
    * Quicker innovation
    * Continuous improvement
    * Rapid adaptation to change
    * More delighted customers
    * Accelerated pace from idea to delivery

## Scrum Is Iterative & Incremental

Scrum is also both iterative and incremental.

### Iterative

Iterative processes are a way to arrive at a decision or a desired result by repeating rounds of analysis or a cycle of operations. The objective is to bring the desired decision or result closer to discovery with each repetition (iteration). Scrum’s use of a repeating cycle of iterations is iterative.

### Incremental

Incremental refers to a series of small improvements to an existing product or product line that usually helps maintain or improve its competitive position over time. Incremental innovation is regularly used within the high technology business by companies that need to continue to improve their products to include new features increasingly desired by consumers. The way scrum teams deliver pieces of functionality into small batches is incremental.

## The Five Scrum Values

A team’s success with scrum depends on five values: commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect.

### Commitment

Allows Scrum Teams to Be Agile

The scrum value of commitment is essential for building an agile culture. Scrum teams work together as a unit. This means that scrum and agile teams trust each other to follow through on what they say they are going to do. When team members aren’t sure how work is going, they ask. Agile teams only agree to take on tasks they believe they can complete, so they are careful not to overcommit.

### Courage

Allows Scrum Teams to Be Agile

The Scrum value of courage is critical to an agile team’s success. Scrum teams must feel safe enough to say no, to ask for help, and to try new things. Agile teams must be brave enough to question the status quo when it hampers their ability to succeed.

### Focus

Allows Scrum Teams to Be Agile

The scrum value of focus is one of the best skills scrum teams can develop. Focus means that whatever scrum teams start they finish--so agile teams are relentless about limiting the amount of work in process (limit WIP). 

### Openness

Allows Scrum Teams to Be Agile

Scrum teams consistently seek out new ideas and opportunities to learn. Agile teams are also honest when they need help.

### Respect

Allows Scrum Teams to Be Agile

Scrum team members demonstrate respect to one another, to the product owner, to stakeholders, and to the Scrum Master. Agile teams know that their strength lies in how well they collaborate and that everyone has a distinct contribution to make toward completing the work of the sprint. They respect each other’s ideas, give each other permission to have a bad day once in a while, and recognize each other’s accomplishments.
