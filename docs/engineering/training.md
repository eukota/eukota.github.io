Too many companies do not value team training. Individual training and self-training is expected. Companies will even buy [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) but they will not set up team training. Companies will make claims about team culture or team frameworks (e.g.: scrum) while not providing training.

There is a collective lack of team training across the software industry. This has lead to engineers being expected to learn on-the-job how to work as a team. Nearly every engineer I have met has a different idea of what teamwork is and I have been on only two teams that trained together. Teams that train together are able to improve via Continuous Improvement faster than those that don't.

## Why Train?

All teams train. Training has numerous benefits to the individual, the team, and the company.

## Address Weaknesses and Skill Gaps

It’s inevitable that employees will have some type of weaknesses in their workplace skills. The good news is there’s always room for improvement. A training program gives everyone the opportunity to strengthen those skills. This helps ensure that everyone on your team is up to par and can perform their job day in and day out. With proper training and development, weakness can turn into strengths and your employees can excel.

## Improve Performance

Once weaknesses are turned into strengths, your employees will really have the chance to improve their performance. Training gives everyone a great understanding of their responsibilities and the knowledge and skills they need to do that job. This will enhance their confidence which can also improve their overall performance. Additionally, they’ll know the in’s and out’s of their role and your company to the point where they can come up with strategy ideas and help other teammates improve.

## Foster Growth

The bottom line of any business is financial growth. If one could do it alone, there would be no need for a workforce. And every workforce must be trained. The better the training, the better your company’s growth. Your most valuable employees are ambitious and have room to grow. By giving them the training they need to maximize their skills, they will be able to fill out those hard to reach goals that only the most talented and dedicated employees can.

## Enhance Satisfaction

By investing in training, companies show their employees that they are valued and that they matter. Because training gives employees access to information they wouldn’t have had access to, they feel rewarded with a sense of satisfaction that employees at corporations with poor training programs tend to lack. This goes a long way in making employees feel appreciated and satisfied with their careers.

## Increase Consistency

An effective training program ensures that employees have a consistent experience and background of knowledge. This consistency is extremely important when it comes to understanding processes, products, or services. For example, a robust customer service training program ensures that your agents and reps are more likely to deliver a consistent experience to customers. Or, for a sales team, this means that everyone knows how to deliver a great first demo. This is a great way to make sure all employees are aware of the expectations and best practices of their team.

## Reduce Turnover

Employee turnaround costs you time and money. By training your staff proactively, you can improve their confidence and their abilities. Fewer mistakes will be made, so fewer people will have to be fired as a result of accidents. Frustration levels will be lower. And you will develop a team of experts that you and your team can be proud of.

## Enhance Company Reputation

A strong training program is a great way to improve your company’s brand and reputation. Employees want to have access to ongoing training and development opportunities. So, by offering different types of training, your company is likely to attract new talent.
