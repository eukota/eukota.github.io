# Microbit and Yahboom Piano

We had an event at work put on by [Christie Chaffee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciecee/) and she had all these prizes to give away. One of them was a [Microbit](https://microbit.org/) with a [Yahboom Piano Board](http://www.yahboom.net/study/piano_bit) and I managed to get it.

The Microbit has turned out to be a wonderful toy for me and my kids to play with.

## NeoPixels

We acquired a small set of NeoPixels from Adafruit and plan to work on this cool [Microbit NeoPixels Tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/micro-bit-lesson-3-neopixels-with-micro-bit) soon.
