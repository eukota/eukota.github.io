# Minecraft Server

I have been playing Minecraft on and off for almost ten years. At times I end up hosting servers. In my most recent effort, I am hosting a Java server running GeyserMC + Floodgate so that my homeschool coop kids can all play together cross-platform.

## Server Information

*Connect with me to get the server information*

## Joining from Java

1. Send your account ID to me
1. I add you to the whitelist and notify you
1. You are able to login

## Joining from Bedrock

For this it depends on what type of device you are joining from. Some of them allow you to set a target server address while others do not allow it directly. Try to set it directly, if the button is missing, you will need to follow the proxy instructions. In each of these instances, we must coordinate in order to add you to the whitelist safely - reach out to me to schedule time.

### from Tablets

1. Click Play
1. Select the Servers tab
1. Click the Add Server button *(If you cannot find this button, follow the Proxy instructions below)*
1. Enter the provided Server Address
1. Leave the port alone (we use the default)
1. Coordinate with me to join the server

### from XBox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch

These platforms have disabled the ability to connect to custom servers from their server dialog so we must use a workaround. There are a couple options. It is unfortunate that these platforms block the normal logins that other platforms allow but we have no control over that.

#### Bedrock Connect

This option involves poiting your primary DNS to a different host and your secondary DNS to Google. There are many videos explaining it like this one:

#### LAN Broadcast

There are a few apps that allow you to broadcast our server as LAN option. In these apps, you must be on the same network as your device. You enter in our server details and the App will broadcast the server as a LAN game.
