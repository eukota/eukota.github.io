We also gotinstruction on how to use it from peers.<br>2) To view a 5V waveform, setting the V/Div to 2V is good because thewave will then take up 2/3 of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the screen. The best setting for Time/Div wouldbe 1 to 0.5 micro-seconds.<br>3) ALT alternates between each signal once across the screen. CHOPbasically does both signals at once...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it does a tiny bit of 1 then a tiny bit of 2, etc.&nbsp;<br>4) The x10 switch allows increases the resistance in the oscilloscopeby 10 therefore decreasing the&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; voltage flow by 10... this is helpful when workingwith devices that might be harmed otherwise.<br>5) DC Coupling picks up all signals. AC Coupling filters out all butthe AC signals.</td><td></td></tr></table></center></body></html>
