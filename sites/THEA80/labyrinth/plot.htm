But this time, the development process would be somewhatdifferent.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>To begin with, Labyrinth would include human characters and takeplace partly in the evryday world. This was not a case of inventingeverything from scratch, even though much of the film would takeplace in a make-believe setting and involve many animatroniccreatures created in the Downshire Hill Creature Shop.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Labyrinth would keep the Creature Shop busy devising everythingfrom talking door knockers to a walking junk pile. It's impossible tocome up with a "typical" Labyrinth character, but the kind ofcomplexities involved can be understood by taking the case of Hoggle- a mjor figure in the movie who reluctantly befriends the film'sheroine.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>On one level, Hoggle was simply an evolution of the "humans withMuppet heads" concept that had begun with 'Hey Cinderella!' Insidethe basic Hoggle suit was an actress provided with a concealed viewhole and a television monitor that showed her what the camera saw.But Hoggle's enormous head went way beyond anything imagined at thetime of 'Hey Cinderella!' This was a remote-controlled, animatronicdevice requiring several people to operate it, one performing thelips, one the eyes, one the brows, and so on - all supervised byBrian Henson.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Coexisting with Hoggle would be characters like Sir Didymus - acourtly terrier who speaks Elizabethan English and rides a sheepdognamed Ambrosius. Other inventions included Ludo (a gentle, lumberinggiant with matted red fur), and the manic "fierys," who could causeflames to leap up from the ground and separate theirheads and limbsfrom their bodies. In fact, Labyrinth would contain the full gamut ofpuppet styles and animatronic innovations Jim had introduced over theyears.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Labyrinth was directed by Jim Henson with all the technical flairhe had brought to his early film projects. And while he did notperform any major characters, several Muppet Show and Sesame Streetveterans did, including Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, and Kevin Clash,along with Brian Henson and Dark Crystal veteran Dave Greenaway.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Labyrinth is a film that combines fairy-tale elements with a storyline that at times recalls books like The Wizard of Oz and ThroughThe Looking Glass. The heroine, Sarah, is a somewhat self-absorbedteenager who resents her baby half-brother, Toby. In a recklessmoment, she wishes that the King of the Goblins would kidnap thechild. Jareth obliges, and Sarah spends the balance of the movietrying to retrieve her sibling by penetrating a maze - the labyrinthof the title - that surrounds Goblin City and Jareth's castle, whereToby is hidden. She is assisted in her quest by Hoggle, Ludo, and SirDidymus, but eventually must confront Jareth on her own and, in doingso, vanquishes her adolescent demons, bringing herself and the babysafely back to the everyday reality of her home.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>The pleasures of the tale, however, are in the telling and - as isso often the case in Jim Henson's projects - the tale is essentiallyvisual. In a sense, the labyrinth itself is the film's centralcharacter, and it is splendidly realized in all its manifestations.In places it is made up of damp, high walls, from which an exoticform of creeping plant watches with beady eyes. Elsewhere, it is likea topiary maze, such as can be found at Hampton Court Palace and informal gardens throughout the world. Sometimes, it is just a rockylandscape, or a forest where the path winds back on itself,presenting innumerable confusing intersections. There are doors thatopen and close by themselves and hidden trapdoors that lead to aninfernal bog or - in one case - to a chute lined with talking hands.Finally, inside Jareth's castle, the labyrinth becomes a complicatedEscher-like puzzle that dislocates space and time. Always, though,the maze is achieved so convincingly that it seems to draw theheroine onward, and the viewer with her.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Some critics have seen films like The Dark Crystal and Labyrinthas having little to do with Jim's previous work, and certainly theydo represent a departure from his Muppet style. But they were verymuch the products of the same sensibility that had produced, forexample, the Saturday Night Live puppets. if Jim had not tackledfantasy subjects in earnest till the eighties, it was not for lack ofinterest, but rather because he had been occupied with other thingsand had not yet attained the technical means of realizing hisvisions. In fact, the fantasy films were just a beginning for Jim,and he returned to this vein again with the brilliant televisionseries called Jim Henson's The Storyteller, which made its debut notlong after Labyrinth's release.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>(The following are margin notes which accompanied the photos.)</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Trying to describe Labyrinth, Jim Henson asked the rhetoricalquestion, "Is it all a dream, like Alice's Adventures in Wonderlandor The Wizard of Oz? In my mind it is. But it's all rather ambiguous- dream or reality? Fantasy or fact? It's whatever you like to makeit."</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>One thing he was certain of was that Labyrinth "is about a personat the point of changing from being a child to being a woman. Timesof transition are always magic. Twilight is a magic time and dawn ismagic - the times during which it's not day and it's not night butsomething in between. Also the time between sleeping and dreaming.There are a lot of mystical qualities associated related to that, andto me that is what the film is about."</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Certainly much of Labyrinth has a dreamlike quality, and itsatmosphere also relates to (as Jim pointed out) to the books that themovie's heroine, Sarah, reads: books like Alice's Adventures inWonderland and The Wizard of Oz. And, as with The Dark Crystal, Jimcalled on Brian Froud to help imagine the world to be conjured up(drawings top and opposite). Appropriately, Toby - the baby kidnappedby Jareth (David Bowie) - was played in the movie by the son of Brianand Wendy Midener Froud.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Jim Henson and executive producer George Lucas stare intently at amonitor as one of Labyrinth's scenes unfolds (above). In addition tohis ability to produce fabulous special effects, Lucas brought hisknowledge of story structure to the project.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Labyrinth was chosen as the occasion for a Royal CommandPerformance, and before the screening, the Princess of Wales wasgiven the opportunity to meet Ludo, one of the movie's mostsympathetic characters (left).</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>With George Lucas as executive producer and Jim Henson asdirector, it could almost be taken for granted that Labyrinth wouldfeature amazing creatures and astonishing special effects. Lucas'sIndustrial Light and Magic effects shop was responsible for the manyoptical effects - camera tricks - such as the matte paintings thatwere used to extend the mazes built as sets (below) so that theyseemed to extend to the horizon (artist's study, above). </P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Meanwhile craftspeople at Jim Henson's Creature Shop (right) builton the experience that had been gained creating the protagonists ofThe Dark Crystal. Among other fantastic beings, the new movie calledfor the construction of a knightly terrier, his sheepdog steed, ahost of vicious goblins, a talking junk pile, articulate doorknockers, and a giant gate that guarded the goblin king's castle byturning into a monstrous mechanical foe.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>"It was at the time of Labyrinth," says Brian Henson, "that theidea of the Creature Shop really became settled in my father's mind.During the making of The Dark Crystal, he began to realize that hehad put a remarkable group of people together and wanted to hold ittogether somehow. With Lyle Conway running it, the Downshire Hillshop had stayed in business by doing work for Dreamchild.&#91;Dreamchild is director Gavin Miller's film about Lewis Carroll'sAlice's Adventures in Wonderland.&#93; But it was with Labyrinth, Ithink, that the Creature Shop really developed into a self-containedentity that would be able to go out and generate its ownbusiness."</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>"The creatures in Labyrinth are the most sophisticated characterswe've evr built," Jim said at the time. "We use a lot ofremote-controlled radio techniques and teams of puppeteers, who eachoperate various parts of the characters. I think that some effectswe've achieved look so real that people won't even realize we've doneanything special."</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Two younger members of the Henson family made significantcontributions to Labyrinth, both as performers and behind the scenes.Along with Shari Weiser, who inhabited the costume, and a number ofassistants, Brian Henson (seen above with Jim) performed Hoggle, oneof the film's major puppet characters, and also served as theproduction's puppet coordinator. Cheryl Henson was one of thepuppet-builders who helped design and develop the characters known asAlph and Ralph, and was also a member (below) of the team thatperformed one of the "fierys" - aggressively hyperactive creatureswho were capable of literally losing their heads.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>The feathery, bright red fierys - who perform an extraordinarydance to a musical number by David Bowie - are just one example ofthe kinds of astonishing creatures to be found in Labyrinth. Amongothers shown on this spread are the goblins (right, above), seen heresurrounding baby Toby (Toby Froud), who seems rather to enjoy hiscaptivity in Jareth's castle; Humongous (right, below), an armored,axe-wielding monster who comes alive when two huge metal gates areslammed shut; the Wiseman (opposite, left), a doddering oracle with abird on his head, performed by Frank Oz with his usual brilliance;and Hoggle (opposite, lower right), a denizen of the maze who atfirst wants nothing to do with Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), the story'shuman heroine. Hoggle eventually helps Sarah reach Jareth's castle,where she finally confronts Toby's captor, played by david Bowie, whohas previously romanced her in a glittering ballroom scene (opposite,upper right). </P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Although the creatures in this production relied heavyily onmodern technology to bring them to life, the world evoked is one offairy tale and traditional fantasy. "Puppetry is an ancient traditionthat draws heavily on myth and legend," Jim explained at the time,"but I enjoy converting &#91;that tradition&#93; to the worlds offilm and television."</P><P><FONT FACE="Minion Web" COLOR="#9999CC">Site created by</FONT><A HREF="mailto:birdfrk2@cats.ucsc.edu"><FONT FACE="Minion Web" COLOR="#3399FF">MeganHumburg.</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Minion Web" COLOR="#9999CC">1999.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Minion Web" COLOR="#9999CC">Any questions or commentsplease feel free to email me.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web" COLOR="#3399FF">ll</FONT><A HREF="labyrinthmain.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web" COLOR="#3399FF">MAIN</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web"></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web" COLOR="#3399FF">ll</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web">PLOT </FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web" COLOR="#3399FF">ll</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web"></FONT><A HREF="characters.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web">CHARACTERS</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web"></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web" COLOR="#3399FF">ll</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web"></FONT><A HREF="images.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web">IMAGES</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web"></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web" COLOR="#3399FF">ll</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web"></FONT><A HREF="fun.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web">FUN</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web"></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web" COLOR="#3399FF">ll</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web"></FONT><A HREF="links.htm"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web">LINKS</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web"></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Minion Web" COLOR="#3399FF">ll</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P></P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
