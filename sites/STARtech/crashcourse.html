It ranges from why atoms form molecules to what different cells in the body do.  This page will focus on the molecule <b>deoxyribonucleic acid</b>, otherwise known as DNA.</td></table><p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td width=80%> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp DNA is the information molecule of life.  It stores all the genetic information that tells what a living organism is.  For example, it is a person's DNA that determines what color their eyes are, what color their hair is, and, for that matter, that they are a human being.  Our DNA basically controls everything about us.</td></table><p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td width=80%> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There is DNA in almost every cell of our body.  It is stored in the <b>nucleus</b>, a pocket in the center of the cell.  For most of the time, it is wound up very tightly.  It only unwinds when it is used to create proteins or when the cell divides.</td></table><p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td width=80%> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp DNA is a huge molecule.  It is composed of thousands upon thousands of smaller molecules.  If one were to look at a very magnified section of DNA, it would look like a double helix, or two interwound spirals (see below).  These spirals are composed of an alternating chain of <b>deoxyribose</b>, a sugar molecule, and <b>phosphate</b>.  This double helix is very, very long.  A complete strand of DNA from a human is about five inches long if it is stretched out straight.  This is incredibly long for a single molecule.  Between each deoxyribose molecule on the DNA, there are two <b>nucleotides</b>.  There are four different kinds of nucleotides: <b>adenine</b>, <b>cytosine</b>, <b>guanine</b>, and <b>thymine</b>.  The molecules between the deoxyribose molecules are a pair of nucleotides.  Pairs can consist of either adenine and thymine, cytosine and guanine, guanine and cytosine, or thymine and adenine.</td></table><p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td width=80%> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The information on the DNA is decoded during a process called <b>transcription</b> and <b>translation</b>.  During these processes, the order of the nucleotides tells the cell to produce certain proteins and how to produce them.  These proteins regulate everything in our body.  This is a very brief explanation, but a detailed description would require too much time.</td></table><p><table border=1 cellpadding=0><td><applet code="DNA.class" width=200 height=200></applet><br></table><center><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td width=80%> Here is a three dimensional model of DNA.
