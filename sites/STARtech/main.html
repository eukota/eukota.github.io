Recombining DNA is the process used in modern science and medicine to produce proteins and genes.  The process involves splicing a gene from a human onto the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of a bacterium.  The gene tells the bacterium to produce certain proteins which can then be harvested by humans.  Recombinant DNA is what is used to produce insulin, the protein used in the treatment of diabetes.  Another use is to let the bacterium containing the new gene replicate and then remove the genes when the bacteria have replicated many times.  This is called gene cloning. </td> </table><br><table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="20"><td bgcolor="white" width=200 height=100><center><h4>If the previous paragraph made little or no sense to you whatsoever or you just want to brush up on your Biochemistry, please click <br><a href="crashcourse.html">HERE</a><br> for a crash course.</center> </h4><td bgcolor="white" width=100 height=100><center><h4>To learn more about Recombinant DNA, click<a href="recombinant.html">HERE</a>.</center> </h4></table></font></td><p><a href="info.html">About the page</a><br><br><br></center></body></html>
